# About the SmartMaaS project

The goal of Smart MaaS is to build an open source, standardised mobility service platform and reference architecture that allows for the creation of new innovative mobility services. This new trusted marketplace will allow for interoperability between different modes of transport. As part of the project, new mobility services will be designed and trialed.

The Smart MaaS platform uses the domain-neutral FIWARE infrastructures and technologies developed as a service-oriented generic service platform under EU funding programs. FIWARE is increasingly seen as the international standard for open source middleware for IoT and Smart City applications. The project Smart MaaS is part of the technology program “Smart Service Welt II”, which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi).
